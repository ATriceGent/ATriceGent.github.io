      <hr>
      <p class="about">  As a Graphic Designer/Artist, Web Developer, Alex plans to spend his career learning from every experience he encounters. His plan to, not only be a master of his trade, but a symbol of  hope for others who are finding their way in life is not something he takes lightly. <span>“With the tools to reach the world, it is our responsibility to spread the news and write the history of our future.”</span> With determination he sought victory over tremendous odds and succeeded.  From small town to world-wide in an instant. His legacy will be one to live on for generations to come.
<br><br>
      An exceptionally inquisitive individual. Empathic. Quick witted.
      Analytical and logical but still a dreamer at heart. These are the qualities that are imbued in the man, Alex Trice. As a young man,  Alex experimented in art and music, learning a variety instruments, drawing, and painting styles. Growing up he was a boy in the woods, fishing, and playing with the native wildlife. But as he started to come of age, the statistical calculations of his life seemed to be leaning into the red side of outcomes. But after years of suffering, a change did in fact come. Surviving the tribulations a young man goes through, he decided to be the person he wanted to be and did it all in stride. These achievements are nothing if not a testament to what his true calling is, Design. Design is communication and <span>“Communication rules the nation”</span>. One day, Alex hopes to form a brain trust of designers who are masters of their trade as well and form the greatest design consulting ﬁrm that has ever been.</p>
